# About Me 

As a passionate and detail-oriented Manual QA Tester, I have hands-on experience in thoroughly testing software to ensure seamless user experiences and product quality. In a recent group project, I was responsible for verifying a financial application, ensuring that various fields and UI elements were displayed correctly and functioning as expected.

Through this project, I gained proficiency in creating, executing detailed test cases and reporting defects. I have a strong foundation in cross-browser testing, requirements analysis, and defect tracking using tools like JIRA.
